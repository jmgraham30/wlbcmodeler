\arguments{
\item{p_0}{A numeric value between 0 and 1}

\item{F_val_m}{A numeric value greater than 0}

\item{F_cv}{A numeric value greater than 0}

\item{mu_val}{A numeric value between 0 and 1}

\item{sh_val}{A numeric value between 0 and 1}

\item{N}{A numeric value greater than 0}

\item{max_iter}{A numeric value greater than 0}

\item{thresh}{A numeric value between 0 and 1}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with the frequency of the allele
}
\description{
Simulates the Turelli et al. 2022 model for a given number of generations
or until the frequency is below a given threshold. This model
incorporates a randomly fluctuating fitness value.
